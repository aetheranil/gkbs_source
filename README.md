The main GKBS SQL source and UI for the new DB titled cropbase_v5. The database is currently being updated by the interns, therefore tables and fields might change during this time. The final UI will be uploaded once every data migration and upload has been completed.



Global Knowledge Base for 
Underutilised Crops
Delivering quality data to support agricultural diversification
By Knowledge Systems Theme, Crops For the Future Research Centre

Overview

Crops For the Future Research Centre (CFFRC) is a centre dedicated to research on underutilised crops for food and non-food uses. Underutilised crops have the potential to improve biodiversity, enhance sustainability, adapt to climate changes, and improve food and nutritional security of a growing population. Gathering and collating available knowledge on these crops will promote their wider involvement in the global food system. CFFRC’s Global Knowledge Base (GKB) is a comprehensive digital archive that collates data related to the value chain of underutilised crops, using state of the art database technologies. GKB is currently in the second phase of its operation and is undergoing a re-design to ensure data is well organised and meet the needs of research, policy and operations. Improving the quality of data through expert validation, gap filling mechanisms and crowdsourcing is a priority in the next generation. Data curation is one of the main activities of Knowledge Systems Theme to ensure the quality of the data that is provided to the users. 

Statistics 

As of September 2019, there are 2700 taxonomic records in the current database; of which 262 belong to infraspecific taxa (below species taxon rank). There are over 600 crops which are regarded as crops that are underutilised in 107 countries around the globe and the data are obtained from many sources. There are over 240K records of metadata which are linked to each collected data under Crop, Agroecology and Nutrient groups. Sub-species nutrition data collection is completed for bambara groundnut and winged bean. Data for more than 20 products and recipes (as part of Forgotten Foods Network) are also stored in digital format. 


Use-cases for data

Data of over 600 crops were used to build a location-based App that classifies potential crops based on their agro-ecological requirements. The app provides a first mover for diversifications projects by providing adaptable cropping options. Currently, the app is under development for the EU region including the UK to provide a primer for transformation of agriculture in areas that are experiencing climate change.

Current database content

The current database content is divided into several groups and the current focus areas 

Crop	Data describing the details of crops 

<ul>
  <li>Taxonomic details</li>
  <li>Type</li>
  <li>Growth cycle</li>
 <li>Crops images and illustrations</li>
  <li>Potential yield</li>
  <li>Crops location-specific “underutilised” label</li>
</ul>


Agroecology	Data related to ecological requirement to grow and season of the crops;

<ul>
  <li>Rainfall</li>
  <li>Temperature</li>
  <li>Soil depth</li>
 <li>Soil pH</li>
  <li>Soil texture</li>
  <li>Season length</li>
</ul>



Nutrition	Nutrients;


<ul>
  <li>Proximate composition</li>
  <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
</ul>


Metadata	Data provenance

<ul>
  <li>Accuracy flag (3 level of uncertainty) </li>
  <li>Contributor</li>
  <li>Date of collections</li>
 <li>Other images related/ documents</li>
  <li>Additional notes</li>
  <li>Reference linked and source type</li>
</ul>

Data collection methods

Data are collected and recorded manually into the database by data collectors. Data are mainly collected from secondary data sources i.e. research and review papers, reports, books, websites, databases etc. Another method of increasing records is through 'bulk upload' where data are formatted in a specific way before automatic uploading. This saves time and is usually done when a huge dataset is donated or harvested from other sources in a semi-structured format. Other data including value chain updates and crowdsourced data are added after quality check. 

Data access 

The database is designed following FAIR principals that will make data Findable through metadata publishing, Accessible through an online interface available at www.selectcrop.org, Interoperable through a robust structure that links data across the value chain and Reusable by scientists and programmers through an Open online Application Programming Interface (API). 
 
Development of new database structure
In late September 2019, a new database structure design was proposed to solve the limitations of the current database to allow storage of more information due to missing/incomplete tables and ease the navigation in the database to open up the accessibility to the public.

Steps ahead

The new database design is expected to be more comprehensive with more intuitive and user-friendly. Expert-based curation system, efficient documentation of local and indigenous knowledge, automated data harvest with artificial intelligence and better dissemination procedures are the components that will be added in the next expansion phase with available funding.
